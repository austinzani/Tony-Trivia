# Task ID: 10
# Title: Implement Real-time Communication System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 6
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop a robust real-time communication system using Supabase Realtime subscriptions.
# Details:
1. Implement room-level updates for game state changes
2. Create team-level updates for answer submissions
3. Develop host-only updates for review notifications
4. Implement presence tracking for online users
5. Create connection management with automatic reconnection
6. Optimize real-time updates for low latency (<200ms for WebSocket events)
7. Implement efficient data synchronization strategies

# Test Strategy:
Write unit tests for real-time event handling. Conduct stress tests to ensure system can handle multiple concurrent connections. Measure and optimize latency for real-time updates.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Set up Supabase Realtime client and connection management [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement the core WebSocket connection to Supabase Realtime with automatic reconnection logic and connection state management.
### Details:
Create a service that initializes the Supabase Realtime client, handles connection events (connected, disconnected, error), implements exponential backoff for reconnection attempts, and provides a connection status API. Implement connection monitoring to detect network changes and trigger reconnection when needed.

## 2. Implement channel subscription management [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.1
### Description: Create a system to manage channel subscriptions for different contexts (rooms, teams, host-only) with proper lifecycle management.
### Details:
Develop a ChannelManager class that handles subscription creation, cleanup, and resubscription after reconnection. Implement methods for subscribing to room channels, team channels, and host-only channels. Create a registry to track active subscriptions and their callback handlers.

## 3. Implement room-level and team-level updates [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.2
### Description: Create handlers for room-level game state changes and team-level answer submissions using Supabase Realtime.
### Details:
Implement subscription to room:* channels for game state updates. Create handlers for team:* channels to process answer submissions. Develop data transformation functions to convert raw WebSocket payloads into application-specific data structures. Implement broadcast methods for sending updates to rooms and teams.

## 4. Develop host-only notification system [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.2
### Description: Create a specialized channel for host-only communications including review notifications and administrative actions.
### Details:
Implement host:* channel subscriptions with authentication checks. Create notification handlers for review requests, game control events, and administrative actions. Develop a queue system for handling notifications when a host reconnects after disconnection.

## 5. Implement presence tracking for online users [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.2
### Description: Develop a system to track and display online users using Supabase Realtime presence features.
### Details:
Implement Presence API integration to track users joining and leaving. Create presence state synchronization across clients. Develop UI components to display online status. Implement heartbeat mechanism to maintain accurate presence information. Create hooks or observables for components to react to presence changes.

## 6. Optimize performance and implement data synchronization [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.3, 10.4, 10.5
### Description: Optimize the real-time system for low latency and implement efficient data synchronization strategies.
### Details:
Implement debouncing and throttling for high-frequency events. Create a delta-based synchronization system to minimize payload sizes. Develop a conflict resolution strategy for concurrent updates. Implement performance monitoring to track latency and optimize critical paths. Add caching layer for frequently accessed data to reduce unnecessary updates.
