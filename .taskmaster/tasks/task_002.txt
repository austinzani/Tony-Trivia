### Dependencies: 2.2, 2.3
### Description: Implement RLS policies to secure data access based on user roles and permissions
### Details:
For each table, implement appropriate RLS policies:
1. profiles: Users can read any profile but only update their own

3. teams: Team members can read/update their team data
4. team_members: Users can read team members, only admins can add/remove
5. game_rounds: Game admins can create/update, participants can read
6. questions: Game admins can create, participants can read during active rounds
7. team_answers: Team members can create answers for their team
8. team_point_usage: Team members can read, team admins can create
9. game_state: Game admins can update, participants can read

## 5. Set Up Real-time Subscriptions [pending]
