# Task ID: 26
# Title: Implement Complete Database Schema
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create a comprehensive database schema with all tables, constraints, indexes, and Row Level Security (RLS) policies as specified in the API specification and development setup guide.
# Details:
1. Review API specification and development setup guide to identify all required database entities
2. Design and implement the following tables:
   - users/profiles (extending Supabase Auth)
   - game_rooms (with configuration options)
   - teams (with metadata and scoring)
   - team_members (linking users to teams)
   - questions (with categories, difficulty levels, and media)
   - game_rounds (with round-specific settings)
   - team_answers (tracking submissions and scores)
   - team_point_usage (for power-ups and special features)
   - game_state (for real-time state management)
   - achievements (for social features)
   - tournament_brackets (for tournament functionality)
3. Implement appropriate foreign key constraints between related tables
4. Create necessary indexes for performance optimization:
   - Index user_id in team_members for quick team lookups
   - Index game_room_id in teams for efficient filtering
   - Index team_id in team_answers for quick scoring calculations
5. Implement Row Level Security (RLS) policies:
   - Restrict user access to only their own profile data
   - Limit game room access to participants and hosts
   - Restrict question visibility based on game state
   - Control team management permissions based on roles
6. Create database functions and triggers for:
   - Automatic score calculations
   - Team membership validation
   - Game state transitions
7. Document the complete schema with entity relationship diagrams
8. Implement database migrations for version control

# Test Strategy:
1. Write SQL scripts to validate table creation and relationships
2. Test all foreign key constraints by attempting invalid operations
3. Verify indexes are properly created and used in query plans
4. Test RLS policies by attempting unauthorized access from different user contexts
5. Benchmark query performance for common operations and optimize as needed
6. Create test data sets to validate schema functionality
7. Verify database functions and triggers with various input scenarios
8. Test migration scripts for both forward and rollback operations
9. Conduct security review of RLS policies to ensure proper data isolation
10. Perform load testing to ensure schema performs well under expected usage patterns
