Design and implement the following tables:\n   - users/profiles (extending Supabase Auth)\n   - game_rooms (with configuration options)\n   - teams (with metadata and scoring)\n   - team_members (linking users to teams)\n   - questions (with categories, difficulty levels, and media)\n   - game_rounds (with round-specific settings)\n   - team_answers (tracking submissions and scores)\n   - team_point_usage (for power-ups and special features)\n   - game_state (for real-time state management)\n   - achievements (for social features)\n   - tournament_brackets (for tournament functionality)\n3. Implement appropriate foreign key constraints between related tables\n4. Create necessary indexes for performance optimization:\n   - Index user_id in team_members for quick team lookups\n   - Index game_room_id in teams for efficient filtering\n   - Index team_id in team_answers for quick scoring calculations\n5. Implement Row Level Security (RLS) policies:\n   - Restrict user access to only their own profile data\n   - Limit game room access to participants and hosts\n   - Restrict question visibility based on game state\n   - Control team management permissions based on roles\n6. Create database functions and triggers for:\n   - Automatic score calculations\n   - Team membership validation\n   - Game state transitions\n7. Document the complete schema with entity relationship diagrams\n8. Implement database migrations for version control",
        "testStrategy": "1. Write SQL scripts to validate table creation and relationships\n2. Test all foreign key constraints by attempting invalid operations\n3. Verify indexes are properly created and used in query plans\n4. Test RLS policies by attempting unauthorized access from different user contexts\n5. Benchmark query performance for common operations and optimize as needed\n6. Create test data sets to validate schema functionality\n7. Verify database functions and triggers with various input scenarios\n8. Test migration scripts for both forward and rollback operations\n9. Conduct security review of RLS policies to ensure proper data isolation\n10. Perform load testing to ensure schema performs well under expected usage patterns",

Implement authentication endpoints:\n   - User registration and login\n   - Session management\n   - Password reset\n   - Guest authentication\n\n3. Implement game room management endpoints:\n   - Create/read/update/delete game rooms\n   - Configure game settings\n   - Manage room access and permissions\n\n4. Implement team management endpoints:\n   - Create/join/leave teams\n   - Update team information\n   - Manage team members\n\n5. Implement game flow control endpoints:\n   - Start/pause/resume/end game\n   - Round management\n   - Timer controls\n\n6. Implement answer submission and review endpoints:\n   - Submit team answers\n   - Host review interface\n   - Score adjustment\n\n7. Implement scoring and leaderboard endpoints:\n   - Calculate and update scores\n   - Generate leaderboards\n   - Track game history\n\n8. Develop Edge Functions for complex business logic:\n   - Custom scoring algorithms\n   - Advanced filtering\n   - Data aggregation and statistics\n   - Automated game progression\n\n9. Ensure all endpoints follow RESTful design principles\n10. Implement proper error handling and status codes\n11. Add request validation and sanitization\n12. Document all endpoints with OpenAPI/Swagger\n13. Optimize database queries for performance\n14. Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse",
        "testStrategy": "1. Create comprehensive unit tests for each endpoint using a testing framework like Jest\n2. Develop integration tests that verify the interaction between endpoints\n3. Set up automated API tests using tools like Postman or Insomnia\n4. Create test scenarios for each endpoint covering:\n   - Happy path (expected inputs and outputs)\n   - Error cases (invalid inputs, unauthorized access)\n   - Edge cases (boundary conditions, unusual inputs)\n5. Test authentication flows with various user types\n6. Verify proper implementation of rate limiting\n7. Conduct load testing to ensure endpoints can handle expected traffic\n8. Test Edge Functions independently and as part of the API flow\n9. Verify all endpoints against the API specification document\n10. Create a test environment with sample data for manual testing\n11. Implement logging for debugging during testing\n12. Test API performance under various network conditions",
