# Task ID: 27
# Title: Implement API Endpoints According to Specification
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 3, 5, 10, 26
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop and deploy all API endpoints as specified in the API specification, including authentication, game management, and Edge Functions for complex business logic.
# Details:
1. Review the complete API specification document to understand all required endpoints
2. Implement authentication endpoints:
   - User registration and login
   - Session management
   - Password reset
   - Guest authentication

3. Implement game room management endpoints:
   - Create/read/update/delete game rooms
   - Configure game settings
   - Manage room access and permissions

4. Implement team management endpoints:
   - Create/join/leave teams
   - Update team information
   - Manage team members

5. Implement game flow control endpoints:
   - Start/pause/resume/end game
   - Round management
   - Timer controls

6. Implement answer submission and review endpoints:
   - Submit team answers
   - Host review interface
   - Score adjustment

7. Implement scoring and leaderboard endpoints:
   - Calculate and update scores
   - Generate leaderboards
   - Track game history

8. Develop Edge Functions for complex business logic:
   - Custom scoring algorithms
   - Advanced filtering
   - Data aggregation and statistics
   - Automated game progression

9. Ensure all endpoints follow RESTful design principles
10. Implement proper error handling and status codes
11. Add request validation and sanitization
12. Document all endpoints with OpenAPI/Swagger
13. Optimize database queries for performance
14. Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse

# Test Strategy:
1. Create comprehensive unit tests for each endpoint using a testing framework like Jest
2. Develop integration tests that verify the interaction between endpoints
3. Set up automated API tests using tools like Postman or Insomnia
4. Create test scenarios for each endpoint covering:
   - Happy path (expected inputs and outputs)
   - Error cases (invalid inputs, unauthorized access)
   - Edge cases (boundary conditions, unusual inputs)
5. Test authentication flows with various user types
6. Verify proper implementation of rate limiting
7. Conduct load testing to ensure endpoints can handle expected traffic
8. Test Edge Functions independently and as part of the API flow
9. Verify all endpoints against the API specification document
10. Create a test environment with sample data for manual testing
11. Implement logging for debugging during testing
12. Test API performance under various network conditions
